# NiBP-visualisations
This repository contains visualisations for Non invasive Blood Pressure monitoring data collected for the masters thesis titled "Development of verification framework for a
component to be integrated in a medical device". This thesis was carried out at a leading healthcare organisation.

The visualisations show an interesting approach to visualize medical data which can be hard to interpret otherwise, due to high frequency of data samples collected over time.
